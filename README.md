# Our Visual Studio Code settings for Unreal Engine 5.6

At the moment, this repository contains one file:
- `settings.json`: All the individual setting changes that we have made to make working with Visual Studio Code a bit better

## To use these
### settings.json
Copy the entire contents of the file. Then in VS Code, press Ctrl Shift P (or Cmd Shift P if you are on Mac), and look up "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"

and paste the contents into that settings.json file in VS Code


Feel free to make prs and suggestions!
